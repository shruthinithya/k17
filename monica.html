<p>
<strong>Courteney Cox</strong> portrays Monica Geller, the mother hen of the group and a chef,
known for her perfectionist, bossy, competitive, and obsessive-compulsive nature.
Monica works as a chef in various restaurants throughout the show. 
Monica's first serious relationship is with long-time family friend Richard Burke. The couple maintains a strong relationship for some time, until Richard expresses that he does not want to have children, much to Monica's dismay. Monica and Chandler Bing later start a relationship after spending a night with each other in London in the season four finale, leading to their marriage in season seven and adoption of twins at the end of the series.
