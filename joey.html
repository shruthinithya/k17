<p>
<strong>Matt LeBlanc</strong> portrays Joey Tribbiani, a struggling actor and food lover who becomes 
	famous for his role on soap opera Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Ramoray. 
	Joey is a simple-minded womanizer. Joey is innocent, caring, and well-intentioned. Joey often uses the catchphrase pick-up line "How you doin'?" in his attempts to win over most of the women he meets. Joey rooms with his best friend Chandler for years, and later with Rachel. He falls in love with Rachel in season eight, but Rachel politely tells Joey that she does not share his feelings. They eventually date briefly in season ten, but after realizing it will not work due to their friendship and, more importantly, Rachel's complicated relationship with Ross, they return to being friends.
