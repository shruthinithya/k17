<p>
<strong>Lisa Kudrow</strong> portrays Phoebe Buffay, an eccentric masseuse and self-taught musician. 
	As a child, Phoebe lived in uptown New York with her mother, until she committed suicide and Phoebe took to the streets. 
	Phoebe is ditsy but street smart. She writes and sings her own quirky songs, accompanying herself on the guitar. 
	
	Phoebe is childlike and innocent in disposition. 
	She tends to use her past misfortunes such as her mother's suicide as sympathy ploys to mock others' self-indulgent self-pity. 
	Phoebe has three serious relationships over the show's run: David, a scientist, in season one, whom she breaks up with when 
	he moves to Minsk on a research grant;
	Gary, a police officer whose badge she finds, in season five; 
	and an on-and-off relationship with Mike Hannigan in seasons nine and ten. 
	In season nine, Phoebe and Mike break up due to his desire not to marry. 
	David returns from Minsk, leading to the two getting back together, but she eventually rejects him for Mike 
	when both of them propose to her. Phoebe and Mike marry in season ten on a snowy wintry day spontaneously.
